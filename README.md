### **Modules**

#### **Simple Calculator**
The simple calculator module provides the following basic operations:

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another.

**Functions available**:
- `add(a, b)`
- `subtract(a, b)`
- `multiply(a, b)`
- `divide(a, b)`

#### **Advanced Calculator**
The advanced calculator module extends the functionality of the simple calculator with more complex operations:

- **Exponentiation**: Raises a number to the power of another.
- **Square Root**: Computes the square root of a number.
- **Tangent**: Calculates the tangent of an angle (in radians).
- **Power**: Raises a base number to a specific power.

**Functions available**:
- `exp(a)`
- `sqrt(a)`
- `tan(a)`
- `power(a, n)`
